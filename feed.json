            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Chris Moise, who was elected last month and became the firstly openly gay Black man to be elected to Toronto city council, remembers encouraging a single mother to run for TDSB trustee.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As a BIPOC person elected to council, Moise thinks it is important to look back and provide mentorship to those coming after him, even if they don’t believe in themselves.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “When I ran for council this time around, I supported my successor for school board — a black woman, who is a single mother working for a non-profit,” Moise said. “When I first approached her, she said, ‘Why me? I don’t think I could do this, I’m not political.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But Moise did not take no for an answer.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “It’s hard for people of colour to actually crack the system,” Moise said.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “Rather than advising the board, you should be part of the board and be part of the decision making,” Moise said. “With people like myself and my predecessor, Deborah Williams, if you’re not at the table, then the voices of our community will never be heard.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Though he’s on council now, he says it’s important that he gives context as to what that means.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “At the school board, one of the first things I did was that I had to review the policy around school resource officers in our schools,” Moise said.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The motion he put forth talked about making sure they go into a community space, such as a mosque or a community centre, and listen to people talk about their experiences with the education system around policing in their schools. Based on what they heard, a lot of Black kids were being carted or given trespass notices and threatened by the police.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I recognize my job, as a school board trustee, not to just support 80 per cent of people who are in the system, but 100 per cent,” Moise said. “If a percentage of us are not safe, then none of us are safe.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    He says his lived experience as a gay man, a Black man, as part of a wave of candidates from visible minority communities, will bring council more into line with the diverse city is serves.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?LANG=E&amp;GENDERlist=1,2,3&amp;STATISTIClist=1,4&amp;DGUIDlist=2021A00053520005&amp;HEADERlist=30&amp;SearchText=toronto\" target=\"_blank\">In the 2021 census, more than 55 per cent of Toronto residents</a> identified as visible minorities.

Myers was one of four Black candidates elected to a council that for years has only had one Black councillor, Michael Thompson in Scarborough Centre, but challenges persist when getting councillors from diverse backgrounds — not just gender or race — to run for council.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I think we have to think of diversity beyond just race and sex, and look at the sort of totality of people’s experiences,” Myers said. “I think I’m the only councillor from Scarborough who takes the TTC as a main mode of transportation.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Myers grew up in public housing. Before entering politics, he worked as a corporate lawyer.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    His prior experience “plays a role in the ways I view different things we can actually do to remove barriers,” he said. “I think we really have to have people involved in their community.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Myers said money remains a barrier for people like him who had never run for political office before, since a large network is needed to fundraise an effective campaign.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “You have to pay people, you have to buy material, you have to rent an office space, you have to pay for a website, you have to pay for data and software,” Myers said. “All of that isn’t free.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moise helped support Williams’s run for trustee, in a move that also included fundraising.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “One of the promises I made to her was that I would actually help her fundraise most of the money that she used for the campaign,” Moise said. “I didn’t just talk the talk.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Amira Elghawaby, who is a columnist at the Toronto Star and has written about the topic frequently, said it should not be incumbent on racialized people to increase diversity.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “You wouldn’t want to add to their work plate, all their work plans,” Elghawaby said. “It’s an additional sort of responsibility to encourage more people from their communities to participate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Elghawaby says part of the solution is government-based.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “The City of Toronto has several programs where they bring-in people” from diverse backgrounds” and place them in the offices of city councillors,” Elghawaby said. “This is one way to create fellowships and internships and opportunities, so people can start to imagine themselves in these institutions.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Former NDP MP Peggy Nash, a distinguished visiting professor at Toronto Metropolitan University, said getting women, in particular, to run for political office relies upon supporting them well in advance of an election.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “Recruiting greater diversity starts well in advance of an election because you actually often have to speak to a woman multiple times,” Nash said. “You have to ask them multiple times before they agree to run, that certainly was my situation; I didn’t jump at it the very first time.”<br>\n  </p>",

She stressed, “there are significant differences” between her and Tory, but she hoped “to have a respectful, collegial relationship” with him.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “Obviously, starting with Bill 39 was a bit of a shock, but I do accept that the mayor's interest is in making the city better,” Saxe said. (<a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2022/11/16/strong-mayors-in-toronto-and-ottawa-even-stronger-after-surprise-move-by-doug-ford-government.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bill 39 was introduced on Wednesday by Ontario Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark</a>, allowing the mayors of Toronto and Ottawa to pass bylaws aligning with provincial priorities if more than one-third of council members vote in favour.) “I hope we can have a respectful conversation about how we disagree and why we disagree and what the way forward is.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Saxe said “a lot of people feel very passionately that we’re in trouble and need action,” and her role aims to remind Tory of longer-term objectives that need to get done. <br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I intend to continue to remind him about the climate crisis and environmental catastrophe, and what’s waiting for young people, if we don’t get our act together,” Saxe said. \"To remember these longer-term objectives consistently requires somebody bringing it up over and over.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Chris Moise, the former vice-chair of the TDSB, was elected in Kristyn Wong-Tam’s riding of Toronto Centre (Ward 13) and echoed Saxe’s approach to working with the mayor.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “There are areas that we can work together on,” Moise said. “So, let’s focus on, you know, the things we can work on together rather than things that we can’t now.”<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I don’t expect to agree with the mayor on everything. And I don’t think he expects that either, but let’s find common ground,” Moise said. “That’s what democracy is all about.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moise also acknowledged the looming debate over the city’s <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2022/10/16/it-pains-me-to-say-it-but-theres-a-1-billion-hole-in-torontos-finances-and-few-options-to-fill-it.html\" target=\"_blank\">2023 budget, with a pandemic-triggered shortfall that could exceed $1 billion</a> and raise the spectre of service cuts.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I’m not in support of cutting services,” but if Tory “doesn’t get more money from the provincial and federal government, he will have to,” Moise said. “I think over the years we’ve cut enough — we’ve cut to the barebones” of public services.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Others newly elected last month included Alejandra Bravo, elected in Davenport (Ward 9) to replace Tory ally Ana Bailã, and Ausma Malik, who was elected in Cressy’s former ward of Spadina—Fort York (Ward 10). Community activist Lily Cheng won in Willowdale (Ward 18).<br>\n  </p>",

As more people filed into the restaurant at Yonge and Eglinton, I noticed another couple ordered without looking at the menu.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Grazie is unassuming, in a way.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It forgoes the minimalist, fine dining approach that’s dominant in the city right now in favour of simple — if a little cliché — Italian decor, in a space that has been organized to maximize the number of tables it has. To some, this might be a turnoff, but I would argue that it is one of Grazie’s strengths because it makes it feel cozy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The walls are decorated to make you feel like you are in a small restaurant someplace in Italy. There are paintings and posters adorning the walls for Italian staples like Birra Moretti, among the owners’ family and closest friends eating right there some 30 years ago. The wood accents of the bar and the brick interior give the restaurant an old, worn-in comfort that makes it feel warm. Nothing about the decor sweeps you off your feet, but it is comfortable and familiar.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/bruschetta.jpeg\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1080\" alt=\"Bruschetta at Grazie Ristorante in Vaughan, Canada\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-xs.webp 300w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-sm.webp 480w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-md.webp 768w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-lg.webp 1024w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-xl.webp 1360w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/bruschetta-2xl.webp 1600w\">\n      <figcaption>Bruschetta at Grazie Ristorante in Vaughan, Ontario. Grazie Ristorante Limited/Facebook</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    For my appetizer, I went with the bruschetta.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I will often steer clear of it because it tends to be over-toasted and weighted down by too many toppings. I was happy to say the bread came toasted and was very moist and rich. The toppings were simple — tomatoes, oil, and herbs – but that was perhaps its greatest strength. Rather than hide the natural sweetness of tomatoes, Grazie’s bruschetta keeps it front and centre, and the herbs serve as a highlight, rather than getting in the way.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For my main course, I chose the Tasca dish.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Featuring one giant pasta filled with spinach and ricotta, I thought the brie was an interesting choice because I simply do not see it in pastas very often. Even though it was different, I thought it was the perfect cheese to balance out the ricotta and spinach. The creamy porcini tomato sauce was flavourful, and I was given a liberal helping. My only complaint about the dish would be that there was more stuffing than pasta, but I was happy to scoop up any leftovers with the bread.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The best part of the dish was the sauce. Cream sauces can often feel excessive — milky, washing out the sharp vegetable flavours — but I was pleased in that it maintained a pointed flavour of a good tomato sauce, while leaning heavily on the richness afforded by the creamy base. There was plenty of sauce, but I still wanted even more of it.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/chef.jpeg\" height=\"1365\" width=\"2048\" alt=\"A chef cooks at Grazie Ristorante at Yonge and Eglinton in Toronto, Canada\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-xs.webp 300w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-sm.webp 480w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-md.webp 768w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-lg.webp 1024w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-xl.webp 1360w ,https://viktorelias.com/media/posts/29/responsive/chef-2xl.webp 1600w\">\n      <figcaption>Chef at Grazie Ristorante at Yonge and Eglinton in Toronto. Grazie Ristorante Limited/Facebook</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Like any great Italian restaurant, the wine list was a staple.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In addition to a decent beer selection and a well-stocked bar, the wine list offered wines from around the world, in addition to a sizable selection of Italian wines that began at affordable prices and rose from there. Keeping with the rest of the restaurant’s atmosphere, nothing on the wine list felt especially contrived or pretentious.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The service was great, and I never felt rushed despite arriving late. My server, Sean, was happy to talk about various things on the menu, and chat about what I was doing afterwards. The food came out at a nice, measured pace, and he was quick to check in to ensure there was nothing else I needed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Places like Grazie are the best finds. Even though it is not the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of fine dining, it does something better than a lot of restaurants nearby: It has good food, simply put, and it has a welcoming environment.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As the neighbourhood changes, I just hope that it stays put.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Nearly 10 years after its initial release as Taylor Swift’s fourth studio album, <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em> manages to be even better than the original. Running just over two hours long, her album features the re-recordings of the original 21 songs from the album and its subsequent era, plus nine new songs. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22278732/taylor-swift-re-recording-fearless-love-story-master-rights-scooter-braun\" target=\"_blank\">Being the second album she has re-recorded in the long process to regain ownership of her masters, it has a lot going for it.</a>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nominated for album of the year at the 2013 Grammys, <em>Red</em> was one of her most successful albums to date. The album marked her transition to mainstream pop, as her songs strayed away from her typical country sound. With songs featuring heartbreak, <a href=\"https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/654352493514473472/ive-always-said-that-the-world-is-a-different\" target=\"_blank\">Swift described the album as a “fractured mosaic of feelings”</a> as she entered her early 20s.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The album featured major hits like “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” but also iconic breakup song and fan-favourite “All Too Well.” With its fair share of hits, it seemed the new re-recordings were going to garner a wide audience of fans old and new, creating lots of anticipation for its release. The album lives up to that anticipation, expanding even further in its maturity and sound than we could have expected.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Being an album almost 10 years old, it is incredible to hear the voice of a more mature Swift reflect on the feelings of the past in the re-recorded <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em>. Her maturity is clear across the album in her voice and in the production of the songs, making her music even better — a common theme across her re-recordings.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    During the process of re-recording her songs, Swift is liberated to do as she pleases with her songs. An almost feminist perspective, the re-recordings allow her to produce the songs the way she wanted them to original sound and not the way some recording label executives wanted. Even on “Girl at Home,” which is considered one of the weaker songs on the album, she adds a more poppy and upbeat sound that gets rid of its original country sound. The re-recordings allow her fans, both new and old, to appreciate one of the songs widely considered one of her worst. By tweaking her original songs, she contributes to an improvement of her own album.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRxrwjOtIag\" target=\"_blank\">“All Too Well”</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example of this, as <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2021/11/22/taylor-swifts-10-minute-all-too-well-breaks-record-for-longest-hot-100-no-1#:~:text=The%20original%20version%20of%20the%20song%20was%20released%20in%202012.&amp;text=At%20just%20over%2010%2Dminutes,37%20seconds%2C%20and%20was%20No.\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" data-link-popup-id=\"1665682846148\">the highly anticipated 10-minute version charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100</a>, making it the longest song ever to hit that position. The longer version, which includes verses and lyrics not included in the original, gives it way more elegance and meaning. It contains some of her most touching lyrics to date as she sings, “They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell / Every time you double-cross my mind.” Without a doubt, the 10 minute and 13-second song ties the entire album together and makes it even better than it already was.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Overall, <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em> celebrates her growth, both in her personal and professional life, as she perpetually improves her craft. Being able to make an iconic pop album even better shows her talent is unmatched.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>",

Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cathmZFeXs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 U.S. presidential election debate</a> between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it’s clear the temperature has changed for the worse in the U.S., at least within the political system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Donald, I know you live in your own reality,” said Clinton in the highly-anticipated event hosted at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, suggesting Trump lies. She also suggested he was and is a racist and a sexist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the debate, Clinton called Trump by his first name — a sign of the lack of collegiality that has seeped into recent U.S. politics, including but not limited to the first U.S. presidential debate during the 2020 cycle between Biden and Trump where Biden asked the then-U.S. president Trump to “shut up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sharpest exchanges in the 2016 debate, however, involved issues of race and gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/birtherism-and-trump/610978/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump avoided explaining his support for “birtherism,”</a> falsely accusing Clinton partisans of spreading it during the 2008 Democratic primaries. He also avoided explaining why he suddenly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-birtherism-campaign-statement-228261\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a>, earlier in the month, that he now believes former U.S. president Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, after years of suggesting otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2020 debate, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-proud-boys-biden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump took the race issue and ignited it on fire when he told the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group, to “stand back and stand by”</a> while denouncing left-wing groups like Antifa — something that exemplifies the ways in which the political temperature and conversation, at official events like debates, has been dialed way up since the 2016 debate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinton, in fairness, said Trump built his entire political career by promoting the claim that Obama was not an American citizen, calling it a “racist lie,” during the 2016 debate. Noting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump’s company was sued for housing discrimination back in the 1970s</a>, Clinton said he “has a long record of engaging in racist behaviour.” Trump answered by saying the Justice Department was suing a number of other companies for racial discrimination at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump did not retract previous comments that said Clinton lacked “the look” and “the stamina” to be president. In additional comments which likely referred to her health, Trump said “I don’t believe Hillary has the stamina” to endure the burdens of the presidency.” Clinton fought back and suggested that when Trump travels to more than 100 countries, engages in marathon testimony to congressional committees, then “he can talk to me about stamina.” Throughout the debate, <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a42442/donald-trump-women-sexist-quotes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clinton made it a point to bring attention to Trump’s past unpresidential comments, including his past references to looks, arguing that “this is a man who calls women pigs, slobs, and dogs.”</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the debate was very much effective in that it showed the ways in which the temperature has heated up since 2016, but it also vindicated Clinton, especially in regards to her comments about Trump’s taxes, in which she suggested he paid none. (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/27/politics/trump-income-taxes-new-york-times-report/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New York Times confirmed this in a 2020 report.</a>) But the real loser in this debate was the American people, who have lost the civility that once ruled their politics, and in the broader public sphere.</span></p>",

De Villa also suggested that all residents restrict all social gatherings with people who live outside their own home, just as the city moves into the red phase of the province’s shutdown system on Nov. 14, the last step before a full lockdown.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The additional restrictions she announced also include a ban on indoor fitness classes, with gyms only allowed to operate if there are fewer than 10 people indoors at one time. Toronto will also require the continued closure of meeting and event spaces, including casinos and bingo halls, among other gaming and entertainment establishments like movie theatres.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “I know the vast majority of people support doing everything we can in order to confront COVID-19 and get our lives back to normal,” Toronto Mayor John Tory said on Tuesday at a press conference. “We need your help right now to do just that.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    De Villa said the restrictions are expected to remain in place for 28 days, starting on Nov. 14, meaning the earliest businesses could reopen is on Dec. 12. The red zone of Ontario’s COVID-19 framework does not require indoor dining to close, but Toronto has decided to do so. “I want to warn you in the plainest possible terms, COVID-19 is out there at levels that we have not seen before,” de Villa said on Tuesday at a press conference. “The trend is upward.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “What’s best for our local economy is also what is best for the health and safety of our residents: Businesses can’t thrive when COVID-19 is surging,” said Toronto City Councillor and Chair of the Toronto Board of Health&nbsp;Joe Cressy on Tuesday at the same press conference. “Business owners and employees deserve to have a reopening that doesn’t put themselves or their customers at risk and that’s sustainable.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \"I recognize that these actions will have economic impacts and I am truly sorry for this, I really am. However, in my professional opinion, the greatest harm would be to allow COVID-19 to continue to spread at this rate,” de Villa said.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Over the past four days, the city added nearly 2,000 new cases, according to the city’s COVID-19 database. Toronto’s COVID-19 test positivity rate has also spiked to 5.9 per cent. “You should assume it is everywhere,” de Villa said. “Without proper precautions and protections, you are at risk of infection.”\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Peel Region is the only other region in the province to have been placed in the red category of Ontario’s tiered system. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoMgUaDWOk\" target=\"_blank\">Peel Region Medical Officer of Health Dr. Lawrence Loh announced the restrictions over the weekend</a>, adding further restrictions on indoor dining and gym activity and calls for residents not to interact with people outside their households.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    “Our hospitals are transferring patients all over Ontario,” said Loh on Monday. “That means our healthcare system in Peel is at capacity, beyond capacity.”\n  </p>",
