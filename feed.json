            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Nearly 10 years after its initial release as Taylor Swift’s fourth studio album, <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em> manages to be even better than the original. Running just over two hours long, her album features the re-recordings of the original 21 songs from the album and its subsequent era, plus nine new songs. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22278732/taylor-swift-re-recording-fearless-love-story-master-rights-scooter-braun\" target=\"_blank\">Being the second album she has re-recorded in the long process to regain ownership of her masters, it has a lot going for it.</a>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nominated for album of the year at the 2013 Grammys, <em>Red</em> was one of her most successful albums to date. The album marked her transition to mainstream pop, as her songs strayed away from her typical country sound. With songs featuring heartbreak, <a href=\"https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/654352493514473472/ive-always-said-that-the-world-is-a-different\" target=\"_blank\">Swift described the album as a “fractured mosaic of feelings”</a> as she entered her early 20s.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The album featured major hits like “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” but also iconic breakup song and fan-favourite “All Too Well.” With its fair share of hits, it seemed the new re-recordings were going to garner a wide audience of fans old and new, creating lots of anticipation for its release. The album lives up to that anticipation, expanding even further in its maturity and sound than we could have expected.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Being an album almost 10 years old, it is incredible to hear the voice of a more mature Swift reflect on the feelings of the past in the re-recorded <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em>. Her maturity is clear across the album in her voice and in the production of the songs, making her music even better — a common theme across her re-recordings.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    During the process of re-recording her songs, Swift is liberated to do as she pleases with her songs. An almost feminist perspective, the re-recordings allow her to produce the songs the way she wanted them to original sound and not the way some recording label executives wanted. Even on “Girl at Home,” which is considered one of the weaker songs on the album, she adds a more poppy and upbeat sound that gets rid of its original country sound. The re-recordings allow her fans, both new and old, to appreciate one of the songs widely considered one of her worst. By tweaking her original songs, she contributes to an improvement of her own album.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRxrwjOtIag\" target=\"_blank\">“All Too Well”</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example of this, as <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2021/11/22/taylor-swifts-10-minute-all-too-well-breaks-record-for-longest-hot-100-no-1#:~:text=The%20original%20version%20of%20the%20song%20was%20released%20in%202012.&amp;text=At%20just%20over%2010%2Dminutes,37%20seconds%2C%20and%20was%20No.\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" data-link-popup-id=\"1665682846148\">the highly anticipated 10-minute version charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100</a>, making it the longest song ever to hit that position. The longer version, which includes verses and lyrics not included in the original, gives it way more elegance and meaning. It contains some of her most touching lyrics to date as she sings, “They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell / Every time you double-cross my mind.” Without a doubt, the 10 minute and 13-second song ties the entire album together and makes it even better than it already was.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Overall, <em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em> celebrates her growth, both in her personal and professional life, as she perpetually improves her craft. Being able to make an iconic pop album even better shows her talent is unmatched.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=855Am6ovK7s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2016 U.S. presidential election debate</a>, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in a sometimes heated debate that revolved around a number of key issues. Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cathmZFeXs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 U.S. presidential election debate</a> between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it’s clear the temperature has changed for the worse in the U.S., at least within the political system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Donald, I know you live in your own reality,” said Clinton in the highly-anticipated event hosted at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, suggesting Trump lies. She also suggested he was and is a racist and a sexist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the debate, Clinton called Trump by his first name — a sign of the lack of collegiality that has seeped into recent U.S. politics, including but not limited to the first U.S. presidential debate during the 2020 cycle between Biden and Trump where Biden asked the then-U.S. president Trump to “shut up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sharpest exchanges in the 2016 debate, however, involved issues of race and gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/birtherism-and-trump/610978/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump avoided explaining his support for “birtherism,”</a> falsely accusing Clinton partisans of spreading it during the 2008 Democratic primaries. He also avoided explaining why he suddenly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-birtherism-campaign-statement-228261\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a>, earlier in the month, that he now believes former U.S. president Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, after years of suggesting otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2020 debate, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-proud-boys-biden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump took the race issue and ignited it on fire when he told the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group, to “stand back and stand by”</a> while denouncing left-wing groups like Antifa — something that exemplifies the ways in which the political temperature and conversation, at official events like debates, has been dialed way up since the 2016 debate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinton, in fairness, said Trump built his entire political career by promoting the claim that Obama was not an American citizen, calling it a “racist lie,” during the 2016 debate. Noting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump’s company was sued for housing discrimination back in the 1970s</a>, Clinton said he “has a long record of engaging in racist behaviour.” Trump answered by saying the Justice Department was suing a number of other companies for racial discrimination at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump did not retract previous comments that said Clinton lacked “the look” and “the stamina” to be president. In additional comments which likely referred to her health, Trump said “I don’t believe Hillary has the stamina” to endure the burdens of the presidency.” Clinton fought back and suggested that when Trump travels to more than 100 countries, engages in marathon testimony to congressional committees, then “he can talk to me about stamina.” Throughout the debate, <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a42442/donald-trump-women-sexist-quotes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clinton made it a point to bring attention to Trump’s past unpresidential comments, including his past references to looks, arguing that “this is a man who calls women pigs, slobs, and dogs.”</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the debate was very much effective in that it showed the ways in which the temperature has heated up since 2016, but it also vindicated Clinton, especially in regards to her comments about Trump’s taxes, in which she suggested he paid none. (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/27/politics/trump-income-taxes-new-york-times-report/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New York Times confirmed this in a 2020 report.</a>) But the real loser in this debate was the American people, who have lost the civility that once ruled their politics, and in the broader public sphere.</span></p>",
