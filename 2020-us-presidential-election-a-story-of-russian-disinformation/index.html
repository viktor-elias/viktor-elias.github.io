The Times' reporting was based on a recent C.I.A. analysis that they obtained, adding, "The C.I.A. has moderate confidence in its analysis, a lower degree of certainty than its 2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russia-hack-report.html">assessment</a> of Mr. Putin's preferences, in part because the intelligence community appears to lack intercepted communications or other direct evidence confirming his direction of Mr. Derkach's <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-intel-repeatedly-warned-about-andriy-derkach-rudy-giulianis-russian-agent-pal">efforts</a>."</p><br><p>On Sept. 22, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/us/politics/russia-disinformation-election-trump.html">reported</a> that Trump was feeding many of the Russian disinformation campaigns aiming to improve his re-election chances.

Facebook said the roughly 10 Chinese accounts and five pages were part of a broader takedown as Facebook enforces its policy against "coordinated inauthentic behavior (sic)" and interference by foreign governments.</p><br><p>On Sept. 24, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/software-provider-u-s-counties-says-it-was-hacked-n1240953">reported</a> that Tyler Technologies, a major software supplier to U.S. city and county governments, had been hacked.

A couple days later, The New York Times broke a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/technology/2020-election-security-threats.html">story</a> alleging that the company was conducted by a Russian criminal group that had tied to the KGB and that it had the hallmarks of a Russian state-sanctioned hack.</p><br><p>On Sept. 25, Reuters and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/world/europe/russia-cyber-security-meddling.html">other</a> outlets <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-putin-idUSKCN26G1LJ">reported</a> that Putin had called for an agreement between Russia and the U.S. to guarantee they would not engage in cyber-meddling in each other's elections, just as relations between the two countries reach post-Cold War lows. "(I propose)... exchanging guarantees of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, including electoral processes, including using information and communication technologies and high-tech methods," he said.

In the assessment, claims are made that Clinton had personally approved an effort "to stir up a scandal" against Trump by "tying him to Putin and the Russians' hacking of the Democratic National Committee," although these <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/donald-trump-clinton-russia-brennan-ratcliffe/">claims</a> were later found to be false.</p><br><p>On Sept. 29, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/mail-in-voting-russian-disinformation.html">reported</a> that Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has seen an uptick in Russian disinformation about mail-in ballots just as Trump has escalated his attacks on voting by mail. Although the reporting says that officials have not "explicitly linked" the disinformation campaign to the president's comments, the Russians usually focus "its disinformation efforts on existing controversies to amplify ongoing arguments."</p><br><p>On Oct. 1, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-russia-disinformation-ex-idUSKBN26M5ND">broke</a> a story that alleged a Russian group accused of meddling in the 2016 election had posed as an independent news outlet in order to target right-wing voters ahead of this year's election.

"While we’ve removed QAnon content that celebrates and supports violence, we’ve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by certain groups," Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence/">said</a>.

C.I.A. Director Gina Haspel "opposed" Ratcliffe's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-intelligence-idUSKBN26M7JO">declassifications</a> of documents, because it could "jeopardize spies’ ability to gather intelligence and endanger their sources."</p><br><p><strong>Oct. 12 to 18</strong></p><br><p>On Oct. 12, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/12/microsoft-trickbot-ransomware/">reported</a> that Microsoft had taken legal steps to dismantle one of the largest botnets in an effort to thwart criminal hackers who might seek to snarl state and local computer systems used to maintain voter rolls or report on election results. "Run by Russian-speaking criminals, the botnet poses a 'theoretical but real' threat to election integrity," Tom Burt, Microsoft's Vice President of Customer Security, <a href="https://noticeofpleadings.com/trickbot/">said</a>. “Having just a few precincts report that they got disrupted and locked up and people couldn’t vote or their ballots can’t be counted — it’d just be pouring kerosene on the fire."</p><br><p>On Oct. 13, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/facebook-bans-anti-vax-ads.html">reported</a> that Facebook will ban anti-vaccination advertisements.

"The FBI seized the laptop and a hard drive through a grand jury subpoena," NBC reported.

"Bruce Golding, a reporter at the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid since 2007, did not allow his byline to be used because he had concerns over the article’s credibility," The Times reported.

A few days prior, NBC News' <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/feds-examining-if-alleged-hunter-biden-emails-are-linked-foreign-n1243620">reporting</a> questioned whether the release was a foreign intelligence operation, arguing that the F.B.I. opening an investigation into this provoked many questions of whether it was credible reporting.</p><br><p>On Oct. 22, The Washington Post and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-russia-election-interference.html">other</a> outlets <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/">reported</a> that officials blamed Iran of targeting Americans voters with fake but menacing emails and warned that both Iran and Russia had obtained voter data that could be used to "endanger the upcoming elections." Ratcliffe said the voter data, which includes some data that is public and some that is commercially available, "Can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy."</p><br><p>On Oct. 22, NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/22/926825699/ongoing-russian-cyberattacks-are-targeting-u-s-election-systems-feds-say">reported</a> that Russian cyberattacks targeted a wide swath of American government networks, including those involved in the ongoing election. In an FBI <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a">bulletin</a>, officials said, "As this recent malicious activity has been directed at … government networks, there may be some risk to elections information … However, the FBI and CISA have no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised." Later that day, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/iran-russia-election-interference/2020/10/22/e3c2fc1a-1496-11eb-ad6f-36c93e6e94fb_story.html">broke</a> a story that alleged that in one case, "a small sample of publicly available voter information was stolen."</p><br><p><strong>Oct. 26 to Nov. 1</strong></p><br><p>On Oct. 28, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/28/john-ratcliffe-iran-433375">broke</a> a story that alleged Ratcliffe acted in a partisan way by going off script with his remarks on Iran, when he said they were trying "damage President Trump." Ractliffe also contrasted Iran’s actions with those of Russia, adding, “Although we have not seen the same actions from Russia, we are aware that they have obtained some voter information just as they did in 2016.”</p><br><p>On Oct. 28, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hacker-releases-georgia-county-election-data-after-ransom-not-paid-11603923101">broke</a> a story that alleged a computer hacker, who took over networks maintained by Hall County in Georgia, publicly released election-related files after a ransom was not paid. "A ransomware attack has occurred involving critical systems within the Hall County Government networks, including an interruption of phone services," county officials <a href="https://www.hallcounty.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=829">wrote</a>. "Hall County has also enlisted the assistance of third party cyber security professionals to expedite the recovery."</p><br><p>On Oct. 30, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/most-important-2020-election-misinformation-threat-not-from-overseas.html">reported</a> that former Facebook Security Chief, Alex Stamos, described that election misinformation is not coming from overseas, but domestically. "But at the same time, there is election disinformation out of the White House, out of the Twitter account of the president himself and then also from theses influencers around him trying to amplify election disinformation," Stamos said. "I’m not sure we have a good solution between now and Election Day."</p><br><p><strong>Nov. 2 to Nov. 8</strong></p><br><p>On Nov. 2, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/02/trump-us-election-disinformation-russia">reported</a> that, although officials had warned of foreign interference, the greatest threat actually came from inside the White House. "It was very difficult to see those men in suits talking about interference in the election when the White House is the one interfering with the election," Claire Wardle, the Executive Director of <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/">First Draft</a>, said. "The media’s been obsessed with Russians under the bed, but to have the president of the United States telling people in the US that they can’t trust the results of the election — Putin could only dream of that kind of thing."</p><br><p>On Nov. 2, WBUR <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/11/02/us-election-misinformation-trump">reported</a> that, even though there was some foreign influence on the election, most of the misinformation did not actually come from Russia. "A new report finds that President Trump and the Republican Party are driving online misinformation this election, not shady actors on Facebook or Russian trolls," WBUR wrote. "Journalists don’t want to take sides or appear biased, he says, so Trump’s 'outrageous' claims are put in headlines with a fact-check saying they’re false a few paragraphs down in the story."</p><br><p>On Nov. 5, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-disinformation.html">broke</a> a story that alleged that Trump and his allies are using right-wing media and internet trolls to encourage election officials to stop the legitimate counting of votes. Biden officials, in statements to The Times, decried the Trump campaign for "desperate" attempts to halt a count that seemed likely to end his presidency. "This is part of a broader misinformation campaign that involves some political theater," Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said. "All of this is intended to create a large cloud that it is the hope of the Trump campaign that nobody can see through."</p><br><p>On Nov. 5, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-publicly-frets-over-us-election-uncertainty-but-likely-relishes-it/">reported</a> on the Russian government's reaction to the still-unknown result of the election. "Any uncertainty in the most powerful world economy, in one of the largest countries, has and could potentially have negative consequences for global affairs," Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said. "It seems ridiculous that such a great country, the biggest democracy in the world, that their democracy is so weird and their system is so strange that it brings to the top people like these," Margarita Simonyan, the Editor-in-Chief of RT, said.</p><br><p>On Nov. 8, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/russia-and-china-silence-speaks-volumes-as-leaders-congratulate-biden">reported</a> that Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping's silence, by not congratulating Biden on his presumptive win, was deafening. It is possible the "two likely losers from the defeat of Donald Trump, remained silent, perhaps waiting for the outgoing president to concede defeat."</p><br><p><strong>Nov. 9 to Nov. 15</strong></p><br><p>On Nov. 9, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/world/europe/russia-china-trump-election.html">reported</a> that the Chinese and the Russians painted American democracy as volatile and vulnerable, likely due to Trump's fury at the result. "Russia seized that chance, while China was more restrained, perhaps reflecting cautious optimism that a President-elect Joseph R. Biden could stabilize relations with the United States," The Times wrote. "American democracy had deteriorated to the point that 'one can manipulate it, tune it, tamper with it to achieve a certain result,'" Oleg Morozov, a Russian lawmaker, said.</p><br><p>On Nov. 9, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/andrew-mccabe-testifies-trump-russia-lindsey-graham/2020/11/09/45061300-229c-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html">reported</a> that when former FBI Director Andrew McCabe testifies in front of Congress on Tuesday, he would forcefully defend the bureau's decision to initiative an investigation into the Trump campaign and its connections with Russia. The Post reported he'll likely describe the decision as something of a "duty" to do so, because of how serious some of the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia">accusations</a> in the Steele Dossier were, including that Trump was a Russian agent.</p><br><p>On Nov. 10, The Conversation <a href="https://theconversation.com/russias-rigged-elections-look-nothing-like-the-us-election-they-have-immediate-unquestioned-results-there-149710">reported</a> on why Russia's rigged elections look nothing like the U.S. election, because "rigged elections are organized" and "vote counts certainly don't play out in front of the country on television screens." Over many decades, the Russians have studied American democracy, especially during the Soviet Union, to attempt to figure out a way to rig an election but make it seem like it was open and free. However, "Russian elections are now state-directed performances that eliminate opposition," with random arrests of opposition leaders and even some violence.</p><br><p>On Nov. 13, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/2020-election-trump-voter-conspiracies/index.html">reported</a> on a group of election officials who, in a statement, that there was no evidence of any voting system being compromised in the 2020 election, despite Trump's web of election fraud conspiracies. "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history," the officials said. "Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result."</p><br><p><strong>Nov. 16 to Nov. 20</strong></p><br><p>On Nov. 16, the Financial Post <a href="https://financialpost.com/diane-francis/diane-francis-putin-is-playing-chess-against-the-west-and-hes-winning">reported</a> how Putin was playing chess against the West and was, supposedly, winning. With Americans so distracted by Trump over the past few years, Putin has taken more extreme measures to consolidate his power. "In August, Putin’s rival, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned," the Post wrote. "And Putin is the only major world leader who hasn’t called Joe Biden to congratulate him on his victory."</p><br><p>On Nov. 17, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/17/intel-community-foreign-interference-2020-election-437094">reported</a> that the U.S. intelligence community had begun "compiling an authoritative account of foreign interference and influence efforts made during this year's election — a report that could answer whether the nation's defenses held up as well as they initially appeared." The product, such as the public release, could come sometime in January, giving Biden a look at how to protect future elections from interference and prevent the chaos seen in 2016 and 2020 from ever happening again.</p><br><p>On Nov. 17, The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/27ec8282-edf4-4b31-924d-b990792dc90f">reported</a> that Trump had fired Chris Krebs, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, for publicly contradicting him by saying the 2020 election had been the "most secure" in history. "The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud — including dead people voting," Trump, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1328852352787484677?s=20">tweet</a>, said. "Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency."</p><br><p>On Nov. 17, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-failed-to-mount-major-election-interference-operations-in-2020-analysts-say/2020/11/16/72c62b0c-1880-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html">broke</a> a story that alleged Russia failed to "mount any major hacking or disinformation operations to interfere in the presidential election," because Americans and social media giants were on the lookout for posts that seemed suspicious. "This year, U.S. Cyber Command pursued a new approach to countering Russian hackers who might want to disrupt the election," The Post wrote. "In a series of operations, the military attacked their systems and fell back at random intervals to keep them off balance."</p><br><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><br><p>Since the Cold War, relations between Russia and the U.S. have been flawed at best.</p><br><p>It is clear, just by some of the actions and statements put out by officials in both countries over the last four years, that relations would not be repaired quickly and easily.</p><br><p>Although Biden has pledged to be more diplomatic with Russia than Obama was, it is very unclear if Putin —&nbsp;who still has not congratulated Biden on his win —&nbsp;will be open to better dialogue, once Biden is inaugurated in Jan. In more positive terms, it is possible both superpowers may cooperate on a number of limited goals, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to fix supply chain issues when manufacturing for the vaccine commences but I would not bet on it.</p><br><p>If there is one thing I have learned, by analyzing about three months of articles on the Russia investigation, it is that a free press is important to democracy. But it is even more essential that any sense of bias or war-mongering be quieted down, because The New York Times' reporting can sometimes sound like it was coming directly from the Pentagon. Additionally, it is important to note that, even though Russia clearly has been interfering in U.S. elections, it is not something unique to them: The U.S. has done the same in virtually every problematic region of the world, often with devastating consequences, as we have learned during the Cold War and even in the Middle East.</p><br><p>American imperialism, in all its guts and glory, simply feels irresponsible right now.</p><br><p>There is no question about it, American influence in world affairs has been helpful at times, but when it is nefarious, it only hurts the most vulnerable: Just take a look at Syria, likely a conflict fuelled not by a fight for democracy but for oil. And it is a similar story in Afghanistan, after 9/11, even after it was proven President George W. Bush knew they were not responsible for the terror attack, as The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/">outlined</a>.</p><br><p>The U.S. has a president declaring he wants legal votes to be thrown out, because he will lose. If that does not tell you much about what kind of a mess the country is in right now, I am not sure what would. The Russians, on the other hand, are nipping at the heels of a full-fledged dictatorship —&nbsp;and even approaching Soviet Union-style leadership, with Putin —&nbsp;so they can not really brag about their system either, but at least they are not tilting towards a constitutional crisis.</p><br><p>In conclusion, both Russia and U.S. have lacked the ability to truly have decent diplomacy for many decades, often embarrassingly. It is sure as hell time they sat down and figured out what type of world they want to leave their children, because without either superpower's help, Iran will be pointing nuclear weapons at the world and Israel in 2021, even with American or Russian "interference" running rampant.</p><br><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><br><p>Bloomberg<br>BuzzFeed News<br>CBS News<br>CNBC<br>CNN<br>Mother
